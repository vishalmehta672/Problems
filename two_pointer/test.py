"""The two-pointer technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems efficiently, especially those involving arrays or sequences. It works by using two pointers (indices) that traverse the data structure in a specific way, often reducing the time complexity to O(n).

Hereâ€™s how the two-pointer algorithm works and when to use it:

How It Works
Initialize Two Pointers:

Start with two pointers, often named left and right.

Typically, left starts at the beginning of the array (index 0), and right starts at the end (index n-1), but this can vary depending on the problem.

Move the Pointers:

Move the pointers toward each other or in the same direction based on a condition.

The movement depends on the problem and the comparison between the values at the pointers.

Termination Condition:

The algorithm stops when the pointers meet or cross each other."""
